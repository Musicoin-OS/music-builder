Musicoin Build Server

This solution right now used as build server for [Musicoin Desktop Wallet](https://github.com/Musicoin/desktop)

But actually could be used as example how to setup builder server for any NW.js application.

By default we presume that you'll able to install all used software by yourself, and only harder parts are covered.
